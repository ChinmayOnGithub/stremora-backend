# Hybrid Storage Setup (Cloudinary + S3 Fallback)

## Overview

Your app now uses a smart hybrid storage strategy:
1. **Primary**: Cloudinary (free tier - 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth)
2. **Fallback**: AWS S3 (when Cloudinary fails or is unavailable)

## How It Works

```
Upload Request
    ‚Üì
Try Cloudinary First
    ‚Üì
Success? ‚Üí Use Cloudinary (mark as "cloudinary")
    ‚Üì
Failed? ‚Üí Try S3 Fallback (mark as "s3")
    ‚Üì
Store video with provider info in database
```

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install AWS SDK (for S3 fallback)

```bash
bun add @aws-sdk/client-s3
```

### 2. Add S3 Credentials to .env

Add these to your existing `.env` file:

```env
# Existing Cloudinary config (keep these)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dmoyyrmxr
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=314874596436248
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=SqgNEIl400g6fy4d1LXcM6WdY4k

# New S3 config (add these)
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=stremora-videos
```

### 3. Setup AWS S3 (Quick Steps)

1. **Create AWS Account**: https://aws.amazon.com/ (free tier available)

2. **Create S3 Bucket**:
   - Go to S3 Console
   - Click "Create bucket"
   - Name: `stremora-videos` (or your choice)
   - Region: `us-east-1`
   - Uncheck "Block all public access"
   - Create bucket

3. **Set Bucket Policy**:
   - Go to bucket ‚Üí Permissions ‚Üí Bucket Policy
   - Add this policy (replace YOUR-BUCKET-NAME):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

4. **Create IAM User**:
   - Go to IAM ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Add user
   - Name: `stremora-uploader`
   - Access type: Programmatic access
   - Attach policy: `AmazonS3FullAccess`
   - Copy Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

### 4. Test the Setup

Restart your server and try uploading a video:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Watch the console logs:
- `üì§ [Storage] Attempting Cloudinary upload first...`
- If Cloudinary works: `‚úÖ [Storage] Cloudinary upload successful!`
- If Cloudinary fails: `‚ö†Ô∏è [Storage] Cloudinary failed, trying S3 fallback...`
- Then: `‚úÖ [Storage] S3 fallback successful!`

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Reliability**
- If Cloudinary has issues, S3 takes over automatically
- No downtime for your users

### 2. **Cost Optimization**
- Use Cloudinary's free tier first (25GB free)
- Only use S3 when needed (pay-as-you-go)
- Best of both worlds

### 3. **Flexibility**
- Can switch providers anytime
- Database tracks which provider stores each video
- Easy to migrate videos between providers later

### 4. **Production Ready**
- Industry-standard approach
- Used by major platforms
- Scalable architecture

## Database Schema

Videos now store which provider was used:

```javascript
{
  videoFile: {
    url: "https://...",
    public_id: "video_id",
    storage_provider: "cloudinary" // or "s3"
  }
}
```

## Monitoring

Check your logs to see which provider is being used:

```
üì¶ Storage provider: cloudinary  // Using Cloudinary
üì¶ Storage provider: s3          // Using S3 fallback
```

## Cost Tracking

### Cloudinary Free Tier:
- 25 GB storage
- 25 GB bandwidth/month
- Monitor at: https://cloudinary.com/console

### AWS S3 Free Tier (first 12 months):
- 5 GB storage
- 20,000 GET requests
- 2,000 PUT requests
- Monitor at: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/

## Troubleshooting

### Both providers fail:
1. Check Cloudinary credentials in .env
2. Check S3 credentials in .env
3. Verify S3 bucket exists and is accessible
4. Check bucket policy allows public read

### Videos upload but can't play:
1. Check bucket policy is set correctly
2. Verify CORS settings if needed
3. Test URL directly in browser

### Want to force S3 only:
In `src/utils/storage.js`, comment out Cloudinary attempt and go straight to S3.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Load Balancing**: Distribute uploads between providers
2. **Cost Optimization**: Choose provider based on file size
3. **Migration Tool**: Move videos from Cloudinary to S3 when free tier runs out
4. **Analytics**: Track which provider is used most

## Need Help?

The hybrid approach is now set up and ready to go. Just add your S3 credentials and it will automatically fall back to S3 when Cloudinary has issues!
